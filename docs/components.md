## `SentencePopover`

## `VocabularyList`
Collapsible accordion of vocab cards. Props: `renderChars` (ruby romanization), TTS props (`speakText`, `speakingKey`, `ttsSupported`), translation props (`onTranslateExample`, `translatingKey`, `vocabTranslations`). Inline TTS (🔊) and EN buttons when `showParagraphTools` is true.

When sentence translation is ON, batch-translates examples via Google Translate before export. Reads `exportSentenceRom` and `exportSentenceTrans` from state directly.
